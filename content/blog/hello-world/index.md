# Hello World!

I would like this post to serve as a very brief introduction about me, and what I hope to achieve with my writing.

#### About me

My name is Douglas Petla, and I am an engineer that found a passion in software development and transitioned to working full-time as a software developer.

Lately, I've been working mostly with front-end development with Javascript, Typescript, and Angular, and some backend using Java and Spring boot.

#### Starting a personal blog

I've been thinking about the idea of starting my own blog to talk about web development and other things I find interesting for some time now, but I have always held back on the idea due the fact to writing is not my forte.

I decide not to care about my fears and laziness toward writing and actually start doing it. I believe the process of research and documenting the things I learn and practice via blog posts will help me better understands some topics, but more importantly, it may help someone also.

My goal starting this blog is that you can take something - anything - from the content on this blog, which can benefit you and your approach to developing great software.
